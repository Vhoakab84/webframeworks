Webframeworks
=============

This is an open source book covering web frameworks and their implementation.

To build the book:

* Checkout the source
* run *make*

By default this will build a PDF of the book.

The Makefile is merely an import of `LaTeX.mk`_, which is also included.

.. _`LaTeX.mk`: http://latex-mk.sourceforge.net/

   Mentions a lot of the MVC paper/framework and how it is used in Rails.
