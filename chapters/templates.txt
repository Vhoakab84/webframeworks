\section{Templates}

Originally seen as views, template have grown to blur the lines between
controllers and views. In modern webframeworks, templates are used to
render a markup language by passing in variables to the templating
engine.

Jinja2 (Python) is a well-known templating language, along with ERB (Rub), and
Handlebars (JavaScript).
