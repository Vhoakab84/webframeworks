\chapter{Views}

A view in the classic MVC sense is one representation of the data. One
view might be a table, or another an indexed list, and another a graph
or plot.

Modern webframeworks implement views through the use of templates. The
controller takes data from a model (or database) and displays it in
a markup language, like HTML, XML, or JSON.
