\chapter{Views}

A view in the classic MVC sense is one representation of the data. One
view might be a table, or another an indexed list, and another a graph
or plot. In Django for example, views are actually Django templates,
whereas Django 'views' are the controllers.

If a webframework were to implement modern views, the would return data
formated by parameters passed in. One view would be the JSON
representation of the data, while another was HTML, and yet another was
YAML.
