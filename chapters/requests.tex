\chapter{Requests}

Requests are the one of the first deviations from the classic MVC
framework. Websites are navigated through a series of requests to a
server. These requests are then passed through to an application that
knows what to do when someone asks for \emph{/home.html}

These requests don't fit well at all into the MVC framework. They could
be thought of as controllers, but since they pass a user onto a
controller that won't work.
